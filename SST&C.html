<b>T&Cs for 'Sketch commissions' during a 'sketch stream':
<br>
At <a href="http://tigerdile.com/stream/swizzlestix">tigerdile.com/stream/swizzlestix</a></b><br>
<br>
<br>
•Only so many slots can be taken each day, this will be decided by Swizz at the start of the stream and may be included in any journals he posts.<br>
•To apply for a slot, you inquire about them in-stream with Swizzlestix. He should give you a number, which will be added to a pool of numbers belonging to other applicants. As the stream starts, a 'Random Number Generator' will be used to determine which of the applicants will be awarded a slot tonight. Swapping slots with other users is handled purely by the users themselves, if the time does not suit. If not all the slots get taken, the remaining available slots will become first-come-first-serve.<br>
•Any one customer may be in said list only once at any given time to allow the most opportunity for other people to apply. For example, If Swizz finishes your commission, and there are still slots available in the list, you may re-apply for that slot if you wish, but no sooner.<br>
•If you are unable to join the stream early enough to acquire a slot, you may inquire in personal note to Swizz. This will however only be taken if you can provide a set, rough time that you will be able to join the stream, and may not include the $5 discount provided by purchasing in-stream. Swizz will however wait for your presence before drawing it. <i>Please see 'Reservation Application Rules' below for more information</i>.<br>
•If you do not turn up at the mentioned time, your commission will be pushed further back in the list as Swizz works through the other commissions he can do. If your commission ends up in the final slot and you are still not present, the slot will be given up to another customer. In this case you should inquire with Swizz what to do, else the commission will simply not be done.
<br>
<u><b>RESERVATION APPLICATION RULES</b></u><br>
<br>To apply for a reservation for the sketch stream, the following conditions must be met:<br>
<br>•You must be struggling to attend stream for when the slots open for application.
<br>•Reservations are no longer guaranteed slots (except in special circumstances); a reservation simply means you will be given a number to be in for the chance of a slot when RNG'd.
<br>•You must be able to attend the stream at some point before the last two hours of the stream (Streams typically last 8 hours)
<br><u>Applying for a reservation will not include the $5 discount for buying in-stream</u>
<br><i>If you manage to arrive in the stream before the RNG takes place, the $5 discount will re-apply.<i>

This does not include detailed backgrounds, and has a limit on a <b>total</b> of two characters per picture.<br>
<br>
Please provide commission details as Swizz reaches your slot in the list. Provide references and descriptions in a note on FA/IB, and let him know via stream-chat once you have sent it, including to where.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Stream Rules:</u><br>
<br>
<b>BE RESPECTFUL</b><br>
Disrespect towards the artist or anyone else in the stream chat will not be tolerated.<br>
<br>
<b>NO sexual/extensive RPing</b><br>
The stream chat is a place for us to talk and discuss topics of reasonable nature, as civilized adults. Long and/or sexual RP posts are not fun to talk around. Please be aware that this is not appreciated.<br>
<br>
<b>NO HAGGLING</b><br>
The price isn't going to change folks. Sorry!<br>
<br>
<b>TAG LINKS AS NSFW/SPECIFIED KINKS</b><br>
If you're posting a link to a reference or even just another image casually, please be sure to mention the link is 'nsfw' if it is adult-oriented. If it involves a kink that generally offends people, be sure to include that in short detail too. This helps individuals avoid being noticed in less private environments. For example:<br>
"Swizz: http://fakeaddresstobut.ts <i>nsfw butt-stuff</i>"<br>
<br>

Thanks for tuning in, and donations are always appreciated! Be sure to let me know in-stream if you do. ^^
